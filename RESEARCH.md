# Basis Target Map - Research & Learnings

## About This Project
Building an interactive map/dashboard for a Basis job application showing CPA firms that would be ideal targets for Basis's AI platform.

## Key Insight: Limited Public Information (Intentional?)

Basis has remarkably little public-facing information. This appears intentional:

### What's Public vs. What's Missing

| Category | What Exists | What's Missing |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Customers** | 1 named (Wiss) | Other Top 100 firms they claim to work with |
| **Podcasts** | 2 founder appearances | Full transcripts, detailed discussions |
| **Pricing** | Nothing | Any indication of cost structure |
| **Case studies** | Wiss quotes only | Detailed ROI breakdowns, metrics |
| **Product demos** | None public | Screenshots, videos, walkthroughs |
| **Blog/content** | Minimal | Thought leadership, educational content |
| **Website** | Sparse - mostly waitlist | Product details, features, comparisons |

### Why This Is Probably Intentional

1. **Waitlist model** - They're capacity-constrained, not trying to generate inbound demand
2. **Enterprise sales motion** - High-touch sales to Top 100 firms doesn't require content marketing
3. **Competitive stealth** - Competitors (Botkeeper, Vic.ai) are watching; no need to educate them
4. **Early stage** - Only ~18 months old, resources focused on product, not marketing
5. **Customer preference** - CPA firms may prefer not to publicly announce AI adoption

### Interview Framing

> "I noticed Basis has limited public information, which suggests a deliberate go-to-market strategy focused on high-touch enterprise sales rather than inbound marketing. This map is my attempt to reverse-engineer the ideal customer profile from the one public case study (Wiss)."

This demonstrates:
- Ability to work with incomplete information
- Understanding of B2B go-to-market strategies
- Resourcefulness in building a prospecting framework from limited data

## What Basis Actually Does

### Core Product
Basis provides **AI agents** (not chatbots) that perform real accounting work autonomously. Key distinction: they "do" work, not just "suggest" work.

### Specific Tasks Automated
| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Transaction Entry** | Automating data entry into ledgers |
| **Data Verification** | Checking accuracy of entered data |
| **Bank Reconciliations** | Matching payables with cash that left the bank |
| **Journal Entries** | Preparing entries with full explanations of logic, data sources, and confidence levels |
| **Financial Summaries** | Creating summary reports |

### Primary Practice Area: CAS (Client Accounting Services)

**What is CAS (Client Accounting Services)?**
CAS = Client Accounting Services = **outsourced bookkeeping**

*Note: Throughout this document, "CAS" refers to Client Accounting Services.*

Instead of a small business hiring their own in-house accountant, they pay a CPA firm to handle day-to-day accounting:
- Recording transactions
- Paying bills
- Reconciling bank statements
- Preparing monthly financial reports
- Payroll processing

**Why CAS is Basis's sweet spot:**
| Service Type | Characteristics | AI-Ready? |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Tax** | Seasonal, complex, judgment-heavy | Not yet |
| **Audit** | Investigative, requires skepticism | Not yet |
| **CAS** | Routine, repeatable, process-driven | **Yes!** |

CAS work is high-volume and follows clear rules - perfect for AI automation. A firm might have 50+ small business clients each needing the same tasks monthly.

### Integrations
- QuickBooks
- Xero
- Existing ledger systems and file systems

### Key Founder Quotes

> "Accounting is the language companies use to understand their business and make decisions. It's a critical part of our market economy and often underappreciated. Basis will give every accountant a team of AI assistants – to transform not just their practice, but to enable teams far beyond accounting to function more efficiently and effectively."
> — Mitchell Troyanovsky, Co-Founder

> [On AI agents] "They're like juniors on the team, capable of entering transactions, validating data, and reporting results—tasks that traditionally consume significant hours for firms managing hundreds of accounts."
> — Matt Harpe, CEO ([Maginative, Dec 2024](https://www.maginative.com/article/basis-secures-34m-to-deploy-ai-agents-for-accounting-firms/))

> "This technology is a new paradigm for accounting. Learning to work with your computer, not just on it, might be an even bigger shift than going from paper to digital. Over the last year, as accountants have experienced what's possible with the most cutting-edge AI, we've seen more and more firms decide that AI must become the top strategic priority."
> — Mitchell Troyanovsky, Co-Founder ([Accounting Today, Dec 2024](https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/major-ai-players-back-basis-with-34-million-series-a))

> "We're putting every dollar back into the platform and team — to invest in ML research, to continue to bring the most cutting-edge AI to accounting firms, and to open additional slots for firms."
> — Matt Harpe, CEO

### Insights from Matt Harpe's Background

The concept of Basis was born when Harpe was exposed to the accounting world while working at BCG:
- He was tasked with finding ways to optimize business processes
- He discovered how rare it was for organizations to leverage granular accounting data in decision-making
- This insight led to the realization that accounting itself needed to be transformed before the data could be useful

## Ideal Target Firm Profile

Based on Wiss as the benchmark, ideal Basis targets are:

### Firm Characteristics
- [ ] **Size:** 200-5,000+ employees (enough volume to benefit from automation)
- [ ] **Has CAS Practice:** Must offer client accounting services
- [ ] **Tech-Forward Culture:** History of adopting new technology
- [ ] **Growth-Oriented:** Looking to scale without linear headcount growth
- [ ] **Regional/National:** Large enough to have budget for enterprise software

### Why These Firms Would Buy
1. **Labor shortage** - Hard to hire accountants, AI fills gaps
2. **Margin pressure** - Automation improves profitability
3. **Scale ambitions** - Want to grow CAS without proportional hiring
4. **Competitive pressure** - Don't want to fall behind peers using AI
5. **Staff retention** - Better work-life balance = less turnover

---

## Opportunity Sizing Logic

### How to Estimate $ Opportunity per Firm

**Approach 1: Based on CAS Revenue**
- Estimate CAS as ~15-25% of total firm revenue
- Basis likely charges based on usage/seats in CAS practice
- If 30% time savings → significant ROI justification

**Approach 2: Based on Employee Count**
- Estimate CAS headcount as ~20% of total firm
- Price per CAS accountant seat × number of CAS staff

**Approach 3: Revenue-Based SaaS Pricing**
- Enterprise SaaS typically 0.1-0.5% of customer revenue
- For a $100M firm → $100K-$500K annual contract

*Note: Actual Basis pricing is not public. These are estimates for demonstration.*

---

## Assumptions Made

### Opportunity Sizing Assumptions

| Assumption | Value Used | Rationale |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| CAS staff % of total employees | 18% | Industry average for firms with dedicated CAS practices |
| Price per seat per year | $5,000 | Enterprise SaaS pricing norms; actual Basis pricing unknown |
| Basis pricing model | Per-seat | Assumed based on typical B2B SaaS; could be usage-based |

**Acknowledged uncertainty:** Basis pricing is not public. Our estimates could be off by 2-3x in either direction.

### Priority Rating Assumptions

| Priority | Criteria Used | Assumption |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| **High** | 300-5,000 employees + strong CAS + tech-forward | "Sweet spot" size: large enough for ROI, small enough to adopt startup software |
| **Medium** | Good fit but larger (5,000+) or less clear CAS focus | Longer sales cycles, more complex procurement |
| **Low** | Big 4 or 10,000+ employees | Will build internally rather than buy from startup |
| **Current** | Wiss | Only confirmed public customer |

**Key assumption:** Firms similar to Wiss are good targets. This is based on one data point.

### Firm Data Assumptions

| Data Point | Source/Method | Confidence |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| Employee counts | Public sources (LinkedIn, firm websites, Accounting Today rankings) | Medium - can be outdated |
| Revenue figures | Accounting Today Top 100, firm press releases | Medium - often estimated |
| HQ locations | Firm websites | High |
| CAS practice existence | Firm websites, service pages | Medium - not all firms advertise CAS prominently |
| "Tech-forward" designation | News coverage, innovation lab announcements, podcast mentions | Low - subjective judgment |

### Market & Business Model Assumptions

| Assumption | Basis |
|------------|-------|
| CAS is primary use case | Wiss case study focused on CAS; founder quotes emphasize bookkeeping tasks |
| Basis targets Top 100 firms | Stated in press coverage |
| Waitlist = capacity-constrained | They're not doing outbound marketing, suggests demand > supply |
| Firms won't publicly announce AI use | Only 1 public customer despite claims of "multiple Top 100 firms" |
| Big 4 will build vs buy | They have $1B+ AI budgets and internal R&D |

### What We Don't Know (And Didn't Assume)

- Actual Basis pricing or contract structure
- Which other firms are Basis customers
- Basis's sales cycle length
- Whether Basis plans to expand beyond CAS (tax, audit)
- Competitive differentiation vs Botkeeper, Vic.ai, etc.
- Basis's capacity/how many firms they can onboard

---

## Potential Competitors (Speculative)

**Disclaimer:** Basis hasn't publicly named competitors, and the accounting AI space is fragmented. This is our best guess at the competitive landscape based on public information. Take with a grain of salt.

### Direct Competitors (AI for Accounting Firms)

| Company | What They Do | How They Might Compare to Basis |
|---------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| **[Botkeeper](https://www.botkeeper.com/)** | AI + human hybrid bookkeeping. $69/month starting. Series C, $89.5M raised. | More established but "hybrid" (humans in loop). Basis is "agentic" (AI does the work autonomously). |
| **[Vic.ai](https://www.vic.ai/)** | AI invoice processing & AP automation. $1,490/month starting. | Narrower focus (AP/invoices). Basis appears broader (full CAS workflows). |
| **[Truewind](https://www.truewind.ai/)** | AI bookkeeping for startups. Generative AI focus. | Targets startups directly. Basis sells to CPA firms who serve clients. Different GTM. |
| **[Docyt](https://www.docyt.com/)** | AI bookkeeping automation for accounting firms. | Similar positioning. Less press coverage than Basis. |

### Adjacent Players (Could Become Competitors)

| Company | What They Do | Relationship to Basis |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| **[Puzzle](https://puzzle.io/)** | AI accounting platform for startups. $66.5M raised. Processes $30B+ in transactions. | Sells direct to businesses, not accounting firms. Could be complementary or competitive depending on how Basis evolves. |
| **[Tabs](https://tabs.inc/)** | AI revenue automation (billing, AR, revenue recognition). NYC-based, $91M raised. | Different focus (revenue/billing vs. bookkeeping). Serves CFOs directly. Probably not direct competitor today. |
| **[Zeni](https://www.zeni.ai/)** | AI bookkeeping for startups. Real-time financial insights. | Direct-to-startup model. Different customer than Basis (CPA firms). |
| **[Pilot](https://pilot.com/)** | Bookkeeping/CFO services for startups. Backed by Bezos. | Service company, not software. Could be a Basis customer someday? |

### Legacy/Enterprise Players

| Company | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Intuit (QuickBooks)** | Dominant in SMB accounting. Has AI features. Basis integrates with QBO rather than competing. |
| **Sage** | Enterprise accounting. AI features via Sage Intacct. Different market (larger enterprises). |
| **Big 4 Internal Tools** | Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG all building proprietary AI. Not commercial products. |

### Key Competitive Questions (Unanswered)

1. **Is Basis competing on AI capability or accounting domain expertise?** Botkeeper has been around since 2015—more accounting know-how. Basis is newer but has cutting-edge AI (OpenAI o3, GPT-5).

2. **What's the moat?** Is it the AI models (commoditizing fast), the accounting workflow training data, or the enterprise relationships?

3. **Will Puzzle/Tabs expand into CPA firm sales?** They're direct-to-business today, but could pivot.

4. **How does Basis differentiate from Botkeeper?** Botkeeper is "AI + humans." Basis seems to be "AI agents that work autonomously." Is that a meaningful difference to buyers?

## Known Customers

| Status | Firm | Details |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Confirmed** | Wiss & Company | Only publicly named customer. Partnership announced Sept 2024. |
| **Unconfirmed** | "Select Top 100 firms" | Basis claims to work with multiple Top 100 firms but doesn't name them |
| **Investors** | Several accounting firms | Invested in seed round - may also be customers |

**Why only one public customer?** Common for early-stage enterprise B2B:
- Customer NDAs
- Firms don't want competitors knowing they use AI
- Basis still in early growth phase (founded 2023)

---

## What Accountants Do With Time Savings

Basis frees up ~30% of CAS staff time. Firms redirect this toward:

| Instead of... | They now do... |
|---------------|----------------|
| Data entry | **Client advisory** - strategic financial guidance |
| Reconciling transactions | **Business development** - winning new clients |
| Manual verification | **Higher-margin services** - CFO-as-a-service, forecasting |
| Repetitive bookkeeping | **Relationship building** - deeper client conversations |

**Business case:** CAS = low-margin, high-volume. Advisory = high-margin. Firms shift revenue mix toward profitability.

---

## The Training Question (Unresolved Industry Issue)

**Concern:** If AI handles fundamental tasks, how do junior accountants learn?

**Possible answers:**
1. AI as teaching tool - juniors review AI's work and explanations
2. Supervised learning - seniors approve AI output, creating teaching moments
3. Training modes - some firms keep manual processes for education
4. Role evolution - "fundamentals" shift from data entry to data interpretation

**Honest take:** This is genuinely unresolved. Good interview discussion topic.

## Basis Multi-Agent Architecture (from OpenAI article)

Source: https://openai.com/index/basis/

### Three-Tier Hierarchy

```
ACCOUNTANT (specifies task)
    ↓
COORDINATION AGENT
    - Main orchestrator
    - Manages all accounting work
    - Decides which Supervising Agents to spawn
    ↓
SUPERVISING AGENTS (1-4 based on complexity)
    - Break down tasks
    - Enlist sub-agents to complete work
    ↓
SUB-AGENTS (specialized workers)
    - Journal Entry Sub-Agent
    - Reconciliation Sub-Agent
    - Technical Accounting Sub-Agent
    - Transaction Classification (implied)
```

### What We've Built vs. Full Architecture

| Layer | Basis Has | We Built |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Coordination Agent | Yes - orchestrates everything | **Yes** - Multi-Agent Orchestrator |
| Supervising Agents | Yes - task breakdown | **Yes** - Data Entry + Verification Supervisors |
| Sub-Agents | Yes - specialized workers | **Yes** (3 of them) |

**Our agents map to Basis architecture:**
- **Coordination Agent** → Our orchestrator that receives tasks and spawns supervisors
- **Data Entry Supervisor** → Manages Transaction Classifier + Journal Entry Generator
- **Verification Supervisor** → Manages Bank Reconciliation
- **Sub-Agents** → Transaction Classifier, Journal Entry Generator, Bank Reconciliation

### Our 3-Tier Implementation

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────┐
                    │   Coordination Agent    │  ← Layer 1: Routes tasks, spawns supervisors
                    └───────────┬─────────────┘
                                │
            ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
            │                                       │
            ▼                                       ▼
┌───────────────────────┐             ┌───────────────────────┐
│ Data Entry Supervisor │             │ Verification Supervisor│  ← Layer 2: Manages sub-agents
└───────────┬───────────┘             └───────────┬───────────┘
            │                                      │
    ┌───────┴───────┐                              │
    │               │                              │
    ▼               ▼                              ▼
┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐                  ┌──────────────────┐
│Classifier│  │ Journal  │                  │ Bank Reconciler  │  ← Layer 3: Specialized workers
└──────────┘  │ Entry    │                  └──────────────────┘
              └──────────┘
```

**Why this architecture matters:**
1. **Scalability** - Add more supervisors/sub-agents without changing coordination logic
2. **Specialization** - Each sub-agent is optimized for its specific task
3. **Error Isolation** - Failures in one sub-agent don't crash the system
4. **Parallel Processing** - Supervisors can run sub-agents concurrently
5. **Human-in-the-loop** - Easy to add approval steps at supervisor level

### Interview Talking Point

> "I built a multi-agent orchestrator that mirrors Basis's 3-tier architecture from the OpenAI case study. The Coordination Agent receives tasks, spawns appropriate supervisors, and the supervisors delegate to specialized sub-agents. I'd be curious how Basis handles lateral communication between supervisors and how failures in sub-agents are escalated."

### Models Used (per OpenAI article)

Basis uses multiple OpenAI models: **o3, o3-pro, gpt-4.1, gpt-5**

**Possible model assignments (speculation):**
| Model | Possible Use Case |
|-------|-------------------|
| gpt-4.1 | Fast, routine tasks (transaction classification) |
| gpt-5 | Complex reasoning (journal entries, technical accounting) |
| o3 | Multi-step planning (Supervising Agents) |
| o3-pro | High-stakes decisions (Coordination Agent, error correction) |

*This is speculation - good question to ask in interview.*
